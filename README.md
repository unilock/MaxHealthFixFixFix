# MaxHealthFixFixFix

> The max health fix mod to put the max health in your fix fix fix

Similar to [Max Health Fix](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Max-Health-Fix), this mod fixes [MC-17876](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-17876), a bug that causes an entity's health to reset to its default maximum value upon world join, regardless of any attribute modifiers.

This bug is noticeable when, for example, the player leaves and re-joins a world while wearing equipment that boosts their maximum health - their health will always be reset to 20 HP.

However, this mod works a bit differently than its competitors, allowing compatibility with both traditional armor *and trinkets* (added via [Trinkets](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets)). FINALLY the [Ring of Odin](https://botaniamod.net/lexicon.html#alfhomancy/odin_ring) works as intended.
